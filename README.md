# Celiac Disease Detection Bot

This is a Telegram bot designed as a companion tool to our main website http://celiaccc.tilda.ws/ (http://celiac.kz but now domen does not work). It offers two key features:

1. **Gluten Detection:**  
   The bot can scan and analyze product ingredient lists to detect the presence of gluten, helping users avoid foods that may trigger celiac disease symptoms.

2. **Celiac Disease Diagnosis Support:**  
   Through a series of guided questions, the bot assists users in assessing their risk for celiac disease, providing preliminary insights before consulting a healthcare professional.

This bot is a convenient extension to our website, empowering users with quick, accessible support related to gluten intake and celiac disease awareness.  

Feel free to explore and contribute to the project!

## How to use

- Send a photo or text of product ingredients to the bot for gluten analysis.
